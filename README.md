# RuneLitePlus [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/runelite-extended/runelite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/runelite-extended/runelite) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/373382904769675265.svg)](https://discord.gg/HN5gf3m)

[RuneLitePlus](https://runelitepl.us)  is a fork of [RuneLite](https://github.com/runelite/runelite) that provides more functionality and less restrictions while staying open source. This is meant to directly compete with 3rd party RL clients that are trying to sell their code.

## Project Layout

- [cache](cache/src/main/java/net/runelite/cache) - Libraries used for reading/writing cache files, as well as the data in it
- [http-api](http-api/src/main/java/net/runelite/http/api) - API for api.runelite.net
- [http-service](http-service/src/main/java/net/runelite/http/service) - Service for api.runelite.net
- [runelite-api](runelite-api/src/main/java/net/runelite/api) - RuneLite API, interfaces for accessing the client
- [runelite-mixins](runelite-mixins/src/main/java/net/runelite) - Mixins which are injected into the injected client's classes
- [runescape-api](runescape-api/src/main/java/net/runelite) - Mappings correspond to these interfaces, runelite-api is a subset of this
- [runelite-client](runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client) - Game client with plugins
