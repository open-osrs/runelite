## Building
We have migrated the project to Gradle. Information on how to setup and build the project can be found at https://github.com/open-osrs/runelite/wiki/Building-with-IntelliJ-IDEA

## Private Servers
Currently we support RSMod which can be found at: https://github.com/Tomm0017/rsmod but should work with any server that follows osrs protocol.
```
Gradle  
enter  
run --args='--rs=RSPS'  
into the tasks box

Jar
Use -rs=RSPS arg.

Exe
Use --clientargs="--rs=RSPS" arg.

-----

Codebase is set to 127.0.0.1 by default and can be changed in the Private Server plugin (requires restart) 
Update modulus in Private Server plugin. 
    
Disable Default World plugin if you have it enabled, this causes issues with codebase.
