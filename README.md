# OpenOSRS injected RuneLite 

[![Build Status](https://github.com/open-osrs/runelite/workflows/OpenOSRS%20-%20CI%20(push)/badge.svg)](https://github.com/open-osrs/runelite/actions?query=workflow%3A%22OpenOSRS+-+CI+%28push%29%22)
[![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/open-osrs/runelite.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.io/open-osrs/runelite)  
[OpenOSRS](https://openosrs.com) is a fully open-source client with no restrictions. We are not affiliated with Jagex or RuneLite.  
  
This is a special branch that uses the upstream client (RuneLite) with the OpenOSRS injector. (bundled)  

From the root module, run the following gradle tasks:  
```clean build run```
  
This branch is still in bringup but most functionality works as intended.  
This branch uses upstreams PlayerManager/OverlayManager etc so keep that in mind if porting a plugin.  
  
Contributions are welcome, but there should be no changes made to runelite-client unless necessary/minor. Mould the api around the client.

## Project Layout  

- [cache](cache/src/main/java/net/runelite/cache) - Libraries used for reading/writing cache files, as well as the data in it
- [deobfuscator](deobfuscator/src/main/java/net/runelite/deob) - Can decompile and cleanup gamepacks as well as map updates to newer revs
- [http-api](http-api/src/main/java/net/runelite/http/api) - API for runelite and OpenOSRS
- [injector](injector/src/main/java/com/openosrs/injector) - Bytecode weaver that allows us to add code to the obfuscated gamepack
- [runelite-api](runelite-api/src/main/java/net/runelite/api) - RuneLite API, interfaces for accessing the client
- [runelite-mixins](runelite-mixins/src/main/java/net/runelite) - Classes containing the Objects to be injected using the injector-plugin
- [runescape-api](runescape-api/src/main/java/net/runelite) - Mappings correspond to these interfaces, runelite-api is a subset of this
- [runelite-client](runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client) - Game client with plugins
- [wiki-scraper](wiki-scraper/src/main/java/net/runelite/data) - Scrapes the runescape wiki https://oldschool.runescape.wiki for the latest npc data
